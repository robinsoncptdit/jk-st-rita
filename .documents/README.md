# Documents Directory

This directory contains markdown files that will be used as context for future prompts and development tasks. These documents serve as a knowledge base and reference for the project.

## Purpose

- Store markdown files containing project requirements
- Keep track of development decisions and architecture choices
- Maintain documentation for future reference
- Provide context for AI-assisted development

## Structure

The directory is organized as follows:
- `requirements/` - Project requirements and specifications
- `architecture/` - System design and architecture decisions
- `api/` - API documentation and endpoints
- `database/` - Database schema and data models
- `deployment/` - Deployment and infrastructure documentation

## Usage

When creating new markdown files:
1. Use clear, descriptive filenames
2. Include relevant metadata (date, author, version)
3. Keep content focused and well-organized
4. Use proper markdown formatting
